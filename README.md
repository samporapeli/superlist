# Superlist
Hierarchical to-do list app

## Benefits compared to traditional to-do lists
- You don't have to know how big your task is. Just add subtasks if it turns out to be big.
- Focus on what you are doing. There are lots of things you need to do, but the app only shows only the subtasks of the piece you are working on right now.
- When you are done with that thing, you'll get right back to where you were so you'll know what to do next.
- If you get stuck with some item, break it down into smaller tasks. What if those smaller tasks stayed organized even when you have hundreds or thousands of them?
- When looking at the bigger picture, the details (sub-subtasks) are hidden.

## Tips for using
- Try to break tasks down to 3–10 subtasks 👉.
- Continue breaking subtasks down until they take about 1–5 minutes to complete ✅.
- Use ℹ️ (text) subitems to describe the task in more detail. Keep the title snappy and short.
- Use ❌ (failed) and ⏳ (waiting) to indicate tasks that might need help  from other people before continuing.
- Use 🦄 (idea) and 💤 (cancelled) to indicate tasks that are not as important but nice to keep around.

### I have so many tasks, where should I start?
You can add deadlines to tasks (press S for schedule) to see which one you should work on next.

## State and future of the app
- I use this for my work every day so my goal is to have the app really functional.
- However, as this is not (yet?) a commercial project, the learning curve might be a bit steep.
- For example the app uses only keyboard input at the moment. Mouse does not do anything and touchscreen platforms are not supported.
- There are no UI animations and very little styling. The app can feel a bit bleak. :)
- I want to make the app look pretty at some point though. Good feel is important for productivity.
- Also, syncing between devices.
